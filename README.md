# Summary of the Object-Oriented Programming Paper

The paper describes a scenario where the Social Outreach team has a new project in which students can participate. They need to code a program to store the details of each student and assign them to a project based on their area of interest. A project has a maximum number of possible students that can be allocated and is classified as either "Indoor" or "Outdoor". Students whose interest is listed as "Both" can be allocated to either indoor or outdoor projects. The program requires the creation of a Student and a Grade class.

A Student class is created to represent each student. It has properties such as fullName, grade, interest, and hours. A Grade class is also created to represent each grade. It has properties such as grade, total, LIMIT, and BONUS.

The paper gives instructions to create a new class called Student. It indicates the properties and methods of the class such as Constructor, getGrade(), getInterest(), getHours(), toString(), and alterName(). The paper asks to create a constructor method that accepts parameters such as inFn, inG, inI, and inH and use these parameters to assign values to the properties. It also asks to create accessor/get methods for the grade, interest, and hours properties. A method called alterName is needed to change the student's name to be in the format of surname and initial of the first name. A toString() method is also required to return all the properties combined as a string separated by tabs.
